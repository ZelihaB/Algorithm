# InsertionSort for the array [22,27,16,2,18,6]
# 1. [2,27,16,22,18,6]
# 2. [2,6,16,22,18,27]
# 3. [2,6,16,18,22,27]

# Big-O = O(n^2) = n + (n-1) + ... + 1 = n(n+1)/2

# Time Complexity: Average case: middle, Worst case: end, Best case: first.

# After sorting 18 is Average Case since it is in the middle.


# The 4 Step for InsertionSort for the array [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
# 1. [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
# 2. [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
# 3. [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
# 4. [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
